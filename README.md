Small website with Bootstrap and JQuery
Implement a simple website with Bootstrap and JQuery that:

- Asks for a github username

- Show a table with the repositories of the selected user with (at least): name, description, number of followers

- The design is not really important but should use bootstrap components

- The input box for the username can be in the same page or can be two pages: one for asking the name and other for showing the repositories

- The website must be stored in a github repository! The result of this task, to be sent to Atenea, is a text file with the URL of your repository.
